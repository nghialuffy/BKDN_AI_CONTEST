But obviously you're not in your office now. I wanted to come over and pickup the briefcase after lunch because they have some document I need for the meeting this afternoon. So please call me as soon as you get this message. In the meantime, I'll call your assistant now and see if he can help me. Because I really need those documents. OK. Bye.
